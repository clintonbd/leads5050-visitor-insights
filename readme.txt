== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this Plugin work with any theme? =

= What additional features are offered in the premium package? =

= Can every visit be linked to a company? =
No, visits from mobile phones and private broadband providers are mostly from shared IP addresses. While the IP address can be linked to the country of origin and the service provider, it cannot be linked to the individual.

= Is the API license necessary? =
Yes, the software will not operate without registering the API. However, it is easily generated with a single click of a button and the only information gathered is the domain name of your site.

= Is there any charge for the API licence? =
The API licence will always be provided free of charge. Any charges are for premium services that are additional to the features provided by the plugin.
